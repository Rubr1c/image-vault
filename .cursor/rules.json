  "project": "ImageVault",
  "description": "A Tauri desktop app written in Rust + React for storing, tagging, and searching images locally. Supports OCR auto-tagging using Tesseract (via leptess). All images are stored locally, and metadata is saved in SQLite. React + Tailwind handle the UI, while Rust handles OCR and database logic.",
  "rules": [
    "Frontend is built with React + TailwindCSS, using pnpm as the package manager.",
    "Backend is written in Rust with Tauri, using SQLite for metadata and the local filesystem for storing images.",
    "All images remain stored locally; privacy and offline-first design are core principles.",
    "Tagging is supported manually by the user and automatically through OCR (Tesseract).",
    "The app’s theme is light mode with a white background and aqua/turquoise accents (#14b8a6 from Tailwind’s teal palette).",
    "UI should be minimal and intuitive: image grid layout, top search bar, and a modal for editing tags.",
    "Consistency between frontend and backend communication is maintained through Tauri commands.",
    "Codebase should stay clean, modular, and easy to extend.",
    "Dont add comments to the code."
